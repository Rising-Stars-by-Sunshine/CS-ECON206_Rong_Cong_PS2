- **Project Summary**: 
  - Project overview. The flow and contents of the project are described in readme.file below.
  - Overview of game theory. This program will outline important milestones in game theory and the definition of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium. This document is uploaded to the code folder as an Overleaf.zip file.
  - Game simulation. This project will use Google Colab and GTE to briefly describe two game theory games and find nash equilibrium.

### Structure
- This project is an expanded project focusing on Game Theory. It specifically reviews the milestones of game theory, analyzes the definition of Bayesian Nash Equilibrium, and simulates two game theory games simply through Google Colab and Game Theory Explore. The two kind of game theory games are the Prisoner's Dilemma and A.
